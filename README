NAME
    Akado::Account - get internet provider Akado account info

SYNOPSIS
    Akado is the internet provider that works in Moscow, Russia.
    http://www.akado.ru/

    Every Akado customer has access to the site https://office.akado.ru/
    where he can see his account info. This module creates Perl object that
    gets account info from that site.

    Unfortunately Akdado account site has no API, so this module acts as a
    browser to get needed info.

    Every module method dies in case of error.

METHODS
  new
    This a constuctor. It creates object. The constractor will not access
    the account site. All network interaction is made in the methods that
    return data.

        my $aa = Akado::Account->new({
            login => $login,
            password => $password,
        });

  get_balance
    It will return number. The number is the sum of money that is left on
    the user account. The currencty is RUB (Russian rouble).

        say $aa->get_balance();     # will print '749.82', or something like this

    If the object hasn't accessed the Akado account site
    https://office.akado.ru/ since the object was created, the method will
    access site, get data from it and store it in the object. The object
    will access Akado site only once, after saving data in the object all
    methods use that cached data.

  get_next_month_payment
    It will return number. The number is the sum of money that the user will
    have to pay for the next month. The currencty is RUB (Russian rouble).

        say $aa->get_next_month_payment();

    If the object hasn't accessed the Akado account site
    https://office.akado.ru/ since the object was created, the method will
    access site, get data from it and store it in the object. The object
    will access Akado site only once, after saving data in the object all
    methods use that cached data.

TODO
    For now the object can return only several numbers, but the Akado site
    has much more data in it. So it will be great if this module can get
    more details about user account.

    For now he module does not have tests. It was created interacting with
    the production system. This is not good. The test should be added that
    mocks Akado site and its data.
